Bart Trojanowski is an embedded Linux consultant and driver developer from 
Ottawa, Canada.  Bart has been hacking on big- and small-embedded devices
running Linux for over a decade.  Most recently his passion has been 
poured into the android platform.

While working, or just hacking, Bart has always depended on source code
management (SCM) software to keep his source safe.  He's tried countless
such tools and settled on Git, and today he wouldn't think of using
anything else.
